        <div class="space-y-6">
            <div>
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">1. Driving Experience, Road Surface Conditions, and Educational Level</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Age of Driver and Driving experience are influential factors in driving style that lead to accidents.
                    Young drivers, recently learning to drive, are more careless and account for a major share of accidents
                    due to overspeeding.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">2. Factors Affecting Fatality</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Days of the week and time of day influence accident counts. Commuters in a hurry during weekdays
                    contribute to higher accident rates, especially in office areas.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Weather conditions have minimal overall effect, though normal and rainy conditions are notable causes.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">3. Vehicle Involvement in Accidents</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Driving discipline significantly impacts accident severity. Violating traffic rules leads to unnecessary
                    incidents. Collisions with vehicles and roadside objects rank as the second most common accident factor.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">4. Service Period and Ownership</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Vehicles with delayed servicing are more prone to accidents. Regular maintenance significantly reduces
                    accident rates.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">5. Impact of Area and Road Design</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Y-cross sections contribute to accidents due to poor visibility. Proper urban planning and road
                    engineering can reduce accidents in urban and school areas.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">6. Environmental and Light Conditions</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Bad visibility combined with poor road conditions, like water or snow, creates dangerous situations.
                    Accidents frequently occur during daylight hours under normal conditions.
                </p>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-600">
